  <h2>What is DeFlock?</h2>
  <p>
    DeFlock is a community-driven project that maps surveillance devices across the world. We help communities hold their government and surveillance vendors accountable and understand where and how they're being watched.
  </p>

  <h2>Founder Bio</h2>
  <p>
    DeFlock was founded in October 2024 by Will Freeman, a software engineer and privacy advocate. On a road trip from Washington state to Alabama, he noticed hundreds of newly-installed cameras mounted on black poles with solar panels in nearly every town he passed through. Curious about their purpose, he discovered they were <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flock_Safety">Flock cameras</a> used for surveillance. Upset about this trend to blatantly disregard the Fourth Amendment, he created a platform that maps these devices, empowering communities to understand and challenge surveillance practices.
  </p>

  <p>Since its launch, DeFlock has received significant media coverage and community support, including code contributors and volunteer mappers, helping to raise awareness about the dangers of surveillance technology.</p>
